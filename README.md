# CDF-2021

Hello! Welcome to my Coding it Forward 2021 project! This project was from when I worked with the U.S. Census Bureau (Economic Indicators Division) to develop a dashboard prototype that is now live: https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/

While all code and development is confidential, you may see my presentation about the prototype in this repository here: https://github.com/codingitforward/cdfdemoday2021/blob/main/Maya_Albayrak_Mounika_Adepu_Sophie_Schafer.pdf
